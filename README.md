Abstract (195/200 words)
Our study examines the proteomic landscape of kidney cortex changes in non-human primates (NHPs) following radiation exposure. Radiation exposure may accelerate renal aging processes, a concern relevant to human health. We analyzed kidney cortex samples from 29 NHPs, 7.7 +/- 3.1 years post-irradiation, alongside 9 age-matched, non-irradiated controls using modern LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling. The comparison of irradiated NHPs, categorized by renal function, revealed distinct proteomic patterns. These patterns highlighted increased levels of fibrosis markers such as collagen and fibronectin, alongside markers of cellular senescence and inflammation. Particularly notable was the elevation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors in irradiated subjects, intensifying in those with kidney dysfunction. The proteomic shifts observed correspond to systemic inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling, implicating radiation exposure in maladaptive renal aging. Our findings suggest that radiation-induced damage could lead to accelerated kidney aging, marked by enhanced senescent burden and disruption of proteostasis. Comprehensive proteomic analysis underscores the vital link between radiation exposure and accelerated renal aging, paving the path for novel biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies. Future studies could explore the therapeutic potential of targeted interventions, such as senolytic or senomorphic treatments, to mitigate radiation-induced renal damage and to combat age-related renal pathologies.
